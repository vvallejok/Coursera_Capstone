INTRODUCTION / BUSINESS PROBLEM
The objective of this project is to help an international investment group to know more about the consumer behavior in NY, so they can make a decision on their plan to open one of the group's most popular venues: an authentic Italian restaurant.
Although NY is one of the most multicultural cities in the world (which is in this case positive, as it means it is also welcoming to foreign food and culture), it is additionally one of the most populated in the US, which means it can potentially be saturated with venues like cafes and restaurants. Therefore, it is very important for the investment group to know not only about the competition they could face, but also about what kind of venues New Yorkers like (and visit) the most. Ultimately, it is expected that a recommendation regarding ideal neighborhood for the opening of their Italian restaurant is included in the report.

DATA
For the purpose of this project I will use a dataset that contains the boroughs and neighborhoods in NY as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. Additionally, I will use the Foursquare API to get the information about the venues in each neighborhood and the geospatial data of NY to understand the planning and boundaries of each neighborhood within the city.
In order to expand/deepen my analysis about the consumer, I will use Google to search for information about each neighborhood, its history, significant trends and statistics that may help me gain a better understanding of the underlying behavior regarding dining and entertainment.
